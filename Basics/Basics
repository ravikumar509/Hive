Hive is a Data warehousing project with which we can summarize or analyze the data that resides in HDFS, Amazon s3 etc..,

Hive project was taken up and developed in FaceBook, as many of the Facebook Data scientists are well familiar with SQL than JAVA, so 
Hive provides SQL like Query language (HQL) with which we can interact and analyze the data.


By default when you start the HIVE it will be in default database
